Implementation from scratch of fourier transform for 1D and 2D inputs. Includes both naive algorithm and fast fourier algorithm, as well as their inverses.
Application of fourier transform to denoise, compress images. Also includes visualization of fourier transforms and average fourier transform algorithm runtimes.

In the scope of ECSE 316 Programming Assignment 2.
